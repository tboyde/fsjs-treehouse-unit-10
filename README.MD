# Full Stack Web App - School Courses

Hello and welcome to my full stack application! 
This app enables users to create, delete, update, and delete courses on the front-end with the help of our custom-built REST API. 


This project encompasses: React, Node.js, Express, Sequelize, SQLite, and makes use of logic needed to create a REST API. 

## Launch REST API

In the terminal, use the following command to launch the REST API portion of this app. 

```bash
  cd api
  npm start
```

After running this command in the terminal, go to http://localhost:5000/ to make sure the app is working properly. You will then see a “Welcome to the REST API project!” message.

## Launch Front-End of App

In the terminal, use the following command to launch the REST API portion of this app. 

```bash
  cd client
  npm start
```

After running this command in the terminal, go to http://localhost:3000/ to make sure the app is working properly. There, you will then encounter the main page for the School Course App.
